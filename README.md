### Edward Hern√°ndez's Coursework

Since I do all my papers in LaTeX and I do them on various devices, I might as well host them somewhere. So here they are. If you really feel like reading my papers, I guess you can.

#### Repo To-Do

* Upload Narrative Medicine blog poses.
* Build a syllabus and schedule for Language Attitudes.
* Upload the Black Feminist Thought Syllabus and start work on the final.
* Upload the readings for other classes.
