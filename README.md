### Edward Hern√°ndez's Coursework

Since I do all my papers in LaTeX and I do them on various devices, I might as
well host them somewhere I won't lose them. So here they are. If you really
feel like reading my papers, I guess you can.

### To-Do:

* Find and add the rest of my Fall 2015 work, if possible.
* Decide on how to handle shared citations.
