# Phonetics & Phonology — Anya Lunden
### Spring 2016 — Linguistics 307 (English 307)

#### Course Goals
-   To learn about the articulation and acoustic properties of sounds.
-   To learn about common sound patterns in languages, and seek to
    understand why they occur (often linking them back to
    phonetic facts).
-   To learn how to analyze novel data from particular languages using
    different types of phonological formalism and recognizing when a
    particular type of formalism is motivated.
-   To acquire general skills in investigating a question, analyzing
    complex data, uncovering generalizations, and arguing in a rigorous
    and compelling way for a particular analysis.
-   To get a feeling for how theory and data benefit each other, how
    hypotheses are developed and motivated againstalternatives and how
    predictions are made and tested
