### Careful

### Fast

### Comments

In the careful speech, most of the sounds I was expecting appeared where
I expected them. The only sounds I didn't anticipate were the /d͡ʒ/ in
"did you," the syllabic consonants /ɹ̩, n̩/ in "yesterday" and "and,"
respectively, and the unreleased stops /t̚, d̚/. I expected these sounds
to be present in the fast speech but not the careful. All of these
sounds were in the fast speech, as I expected, as well. The takeaway for
me is that even careful speech does not line up exactly with our
impressions of what sounds are in a word; what a native speaker hears is
very different from what is produced phonetically.
