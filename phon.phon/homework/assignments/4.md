# Homework 4
## Part 2

Open up the Greek sentence wav file into Praat (again), this time viewing
the spectrogram as well. Taking your transcription from Homework 2 as
a starting place, work through the utterance again, agreeing with or
changing your original transcription. Now that you have some knowledge of
the spectrographic correlates of various types of sounds, and are aware of
the correlations between the height of the formants and vowel quality, you
should be in a position to make increased headway. 

Please include your original transcription, your new transcription, and
a brief commentary on anything of interest (examples of how examining the
spectrogram was able to assist in transcription, a case where you're still
not sure of the best transcription and why, etc).
