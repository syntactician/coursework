HW 2: Transcription
===================

Part 1: English transcription
-----------------------------

Download the `.zip` file of the two .wav files of me reading the same
passage carefully and again at a faster speaking rate. Transcribe each
as accurately as possible, paying particular attention to the
differences between them. (You may want to play them in Praat, as shown
in class, so that you play small pieces at a time.) Then write a
paragraph or two in which you comment on anything of interest (in terms
of the differences), or that surprised you, or that is problematic.

Part 2: Greek transcription
---------------------------

Download and listen to the Greek sentence. Transcribe it as accurately
as you can. Don't worry too much about troublesome spots-- you can
include two different possibilities for a sound, for example.
