\emph{Draw on and refer \textbf{explicitly} to the chapters we've read
so far of Lippi-Green, Cress, Collier, and Reitenauer, the Simmons
reading, and your own experiences. Use APA format.}

\item
  Refer to Lippi-Green about language subordination.
\item
  Recycle Cress quotes about community partners; try to incorporate the
  Johari window somehow.
\item
  Figure out the Simmons reading???

\subsection{Experience}\label{experience}

\emph{Describe ways in which you have observed issues of language and
communication manifest in your previous volunteer, service-learning
experience, civic engagement, or community-based research experiences.}

\begin{itemize}

\item
  like, all of it?
\item
  recycle work where possible
\end{itemize}

I work with debaters. I judge debate. I teach debaters. I recruit and
sometimes train judges. I have occasionally trained new and
inexperienced coaches. Most of the time a volunteer. Frequently I'm
asked for help. Rarely, I'm paid for my help. It's always community
service and service learning.

Every issue in debate is (at least partially) an issue of language and
communication. I often find myself faced with problems discussed in
Lippi-Green!cite! and Cress!cite! in the real world. Language
subordination is active just as Lippi-Green!cite! discusses it
(ch.!cite!). I also find myself in a position to foster and use
community partnerships. I need community partners both to help me in my
service --- other judges to staff events, students and faculty to hone
my ideas --- and to keep me in touch with community ** \emph{needs} **
and ** \emph{interests} ** !cite!Cress --- current debaters, coaches,
officials, and other judges --- since the debate community is no longer
the way I remember it from my high school years.

There is one issue with which I am constantly confronted, in working in
debate: how to fairly evaluate students and their work. In debate, this
is almost a completely a language issue. The student work which it is my
job to evaluate \emph{is} language. Students speak, and I am to assess
it. Not only am I to assess it, I am supposed to say which of two
students (or teams of students) is \emph{better} --- largely better at
using language --- which is a giant responsibility. I feel vastly
unprepared for this, and I know other judges are unprepared as well. I
still think that this needs to be changed.

\subsection{Goals}\label{goals}

\emph{What are some of the specific goals you wish to accomplish through
participation in Language Attitudes this fall?}

\begin{itemize}
\itemsep1pt\parskip0pt\parsep0pt
\item
  hone honors topic
\item
  work with Isaiah
\item
  find my new place in debate
\item
  find an actionable model of assessment
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Schedule}\label{schedule}

\emph{Include an update about your schedule planning progress. Share
what method you are using to schedule and what your major successes and
challenges to schedule are.}

\begin{itemize}
\itemsep1pt\parskip0pt\parsep0pt
\item
  Google calendar.
\item
  Shared google drive and docs with co-workers.
\item
  Shared google calendar with partner and family
\item
  being upfront with my bosses
\end{itemize}

I use a Google Calendar to schedule nearly everything in my life.
