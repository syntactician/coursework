#### Course Description
This community based research seminar will examine the social, economic, and
educational ramifications of language attitudes including: the linguistic
intersection of race, gender, and social class; comparisons of standardized and
Standard English; and the role of linguistics in the formation of language
policy. We will have an emphasis on language assessment in U.S. schools and the
educational ramifications of linguistic discrimination. Our approach will be
hands-on and students will be involved in research design and data analysis.
Opportunities for continued research participation and internships related to
the topic are available upon completion of the course.
