% Write on both questions: two (2) typed double spaced pages or so per
% question.  Do NOT write ``5-paragraph essays''---that is, you do NOT need
% ``introductory'' and ``concluding'' paragraphs for these responses.  [The
% prompt is your `introduction,' so just get to the discussion; `concluding'
% paragraphs are obviously unnecessary for such short discussions.]

\section{Fetters}

% In ``Economy,'' the first chapter of \emph{Walden, or Life in the Woods},
% Thoreau provides an insightful (and sometimes amusing) critique of
% ``civilization'' in mid-nineteenth-century America.  Early in this chapter he
% ``sometimes'' wonders that ``we can be so frivolous, I may almost say, as to
% attend to that gross but somewhat foreign [i.e., to his New England readers]
% form of servitude called Negro Slavery, there are so many keen and subtle
% masters that enslave both north and south.  It is hard to have a southern
% overseer; it is worse to have a northern one; but worst of all when you are
% the slave-driver of yourself.''  And throughout this chapter [see, esp.,
% 982-88] he acidly comments on the ``inherited encumbrances'' and ``golden or
% silver fetters'' that constrain us, on the various ways we have ``servitude''
% imposed on us, or, worse, impose upon ourselves.    

% Some of these constraints/``fetters'' that he discusses are
% religious/cultural/social, some are economic, and some are ``personal''
% (biological/ psychological in origin).  Discuss the relevance of some of
% these constraints/``fetters'' to two (2) of these stories:
% ``Paradise/Tartarus,'' ``May-pole,'' ``Birth-Mark,'' ``Ligeia'' [you can use
% short titles to save space].  How are these constraints depicted in the
% stories, and do they fully support HDT’s points, or is this ``support''
% qualified in some way by the author(s) of the stories.  NOTE: in all of these
% stories, characters may be ``enslaved'' by more than one ``master.''

In \emph{The Paradise of Bachelors and the Tartarus of Maids}, Melville
describes a group of lawyers who at first glance appear to be truly free ---
free of want, of pain, of obligation. They are, nevertheless, fettered, by
their wealth, their social relations, and their own outlooks.

The bachelors are all quite wealthy. While by many analyses, this makes them
free, Thoreau describes a class of people who ``have accumulated dross'' and
``thus have forged their own . . . fetters.'' These bachelors dine on a
sumptuous, meals of multiple courses ``with innumerable niceties,'' share an
incredible amount of liquor and snuff. This is pure luxury, of exactly the sort
Thoreau despises.  These excesses separate them from Thoreau's
``philosophers,'' who live who live ``[poor] in outward riches, [but] rich in
inward,'' and their forbears, the Templars, before ``the worm of luxury crawled
beneath their guard.''

Additionally, they are constrained by the social conventions of their
gatherings to avoid all thought (or at least talk) of pain or trouble. They do
not, as Thoreau describes ``entertain the true problems of life'' --- though
they have the prerequisite Food, Shelter, Clothing, and Fuel --- instead
dwelling on ``pleasant stories'' and ``[c]hoice experiences,'' the history of
the ancient Flemish, the British Museum, etc. 

The Maids, in contrast are fettered quite literally by overseers and by the
nature of their work. They ``serve'' the machinery, worked until they are
``sheet-white,'' with a ``consumptive pallor.''

By Thoreau's reckoning, the condition of the Bachelors is especially
condemnable insofar as they have no slave-drivers but themselves. The Maids,
while still fettered, enslaved much more literally, are not the slave-drivers
of themselves.  Thoreau would seem to say that the condition of the Bachelors
is worse.  Melville seems very much to disagree, as the narrator exclaims, in
summary: ``Oh! Paradise of Bachelors! and oh! Tartarus of Maids!'' There is no
indication that Melville considers the Maids' fetters in any way preferable.

In \emph{The May-Pole of Merry Mount}, Hawthorne describes a settlement where
sadness as ``high treason.'' The colonists of Merry Mount are socially
obligated to ignore problems, to keep up an air of gaiety. Edith and Edgar,
their hearts ``glow[ing] with real passion,'' are aware of the encroaching
problems of the world, and ``had no more a home at Merry Mount.''

The elder revelers at Merry Mount ``kn[o]w that mirth was but the counterfeit
of happiness, yet followed the false shade wilfully.'' They allow themselves to
be fettered to the social practices of the settlement, despite their knowledge
that it is in error.

The Puritans, in stark contrast, are obligated --- both socially and
religiously --- to resist the gaiety of Merry Mount. They labor from daybreak
to dusk, with no pastimes but singing hymns and hearing sermons. These are
social obligations quite similar in nature to those in Merry Mount. Gaiety is
prohibited among the Puritans as sadness is prohibited around the May-Pole.

Endicott, ``the Puritan of Puritans'' cuts down the May-Pole, disbands Merry
Mount, and forces all the ``mirth-makers'' to join Puritan society. Thus, the
settlers of Merry Mount trade their social fetters for new, Puritan fetters,
which are not the fetters they apply themselves, but rather, ones that are
applied at a whipping post.

Despite what reads as a scathing critique of Puritan social mores, Hawthorne
here seems to hold the fetters of Merry Mount as worse than the Puritan social
fetters. The ending seems to imply that Edith and Edgar are, in fact, better
off. While it is ``their lot'' to tread a difficult path, they go ``heavenward,
supporting each other,'' never wasting ``regretful thought on the vanities of
Merry Mount.''

\section{Women}

% Eleven years before \emph{Walden}, Lydia Maria Child wrote: ``I have said
% enough to show that I consider prevalent opinions and customs highly
% unfavorable to the moral and intellectual development of women. . . .  True
% culture, in them, as in men, consists in the full and free development of
% individual character, regulated by their own perceptions of what is true, and
% their own love of what is good'' [Letter XXXIV].  In this letter on ``women’s
% rights'' she discourses on ``the present position of women in society,'' on
% how (in various ways) and why (for various reasons) women are NOT free, and
% ``society is on a false foundation.''  Are her observations/complaints
% supported, or qualified, or refuted by the characters and what happens in two
% (2) of these stories: ``Black Cat,'' ``May-Pole,'' ``Paradise/Tartarus,''
% ``Rappaccini’s Daughter''?  Discuss.

In \emph{The Paradise of Bachelors and the Tartarus of Maids}, Melville
imagines a clear distinction in the ways in which men and women are treated.
The Bachelors are individuals, each having his own character, his own pursuits,
his own stories. They are free to develop their their individual characters,
both in life and in the narrative:
\begin{quote}
	One told us how mellowly he lived when a student at Oxford; with various spicy anecdotes of most frank-hearted noble lords, his liberal companions.
	Another Bachelor, a gray-headed man, with a sunny face, who, by his own account 
\end{quote}

The Maids of the paper mill, on the other hand, have no such individual
characterization. They are not allowed to develop, morally and intellectually,
as individuals, as are the Bachelors.

In \emph{The May-Pole of Merry Mount}, Hawthorne includes a debate among
Endicott, Edgar, and Edith about who is most deserving of punishment.
