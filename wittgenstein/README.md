# Independent Study in Wittgenstein -- Talbot Taylor
### Fall 2015 -- LING 481

#### Course Description
During the semester we will work our way, section by section, through the
complete texts of the *Tractatus* and *Investigations*, focusing on such themes
as propositional content, ostensive definition, language games, tautology,
logical form, rule-following, private language, understanding, and the contrast
between the metaphysical and everyday use of words.  Professor Taylor and I
will meet on a regular basis to discuss these topics and the 6-8 page essays
which I will be writing every other week.  While the primary texts for the
independent study will of course be the *Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus* and
*Philosophical Investigations*, we will also consider some of the vast critical
and biographical literature on Wittgenstein and his philosophy of language.
Some indication of these is given in the bibliography below.
