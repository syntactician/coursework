	Wittgenstein rejects both Moore's `common-sense' (or `realist') argument
	and the sceptical doubt of the idealist which Moore's argument is designed
	to refute.  Why?  What is Wittgenstein's own (positive) view of certainty,
	knowing, doubting, justificational grounds, and `the bottom of the language
	game'?

\citeA{Moore39} famously claims to prove the existence of an external world on
the basis of his certainty that he has hands. The skeptical argument, to which
Moore is responding\footnote{I am not entirely clear on how the ``skeptical''
and ``idealist'' views to which he seems to be responding differ, though I'm
sure they do.} is of the following form:
\begin{quote}
	(P1) I don't know that not-$H$, then I don't know that $CS$ \\
	(P2) I don't know that not-$H$ \\
	$\therefore$ I don't know that $CS$
	\vspace{6pt} \\
	where: \\
	$H$ is a skeptical hypothesis \\
	$CS$ is any common sense proposition or `Moorean fact'\\
	\cite{DeRose99}
\end{quote}
This is formally a simple \emph{modus ponens}:
\begin{quote}
	(P1) $\neg$P $\to~\neg$Q \\
	(P2) $\neg$P \\
	$\therefore~\neg$Q
	\vspace{6pt} \\
	where: \\
	P = I know that not-$H$ \\
	Q = I know that $CS$ \\
	\cite{Robinson10}
\end{quote}
Moore responds by claiming that he \emph{does} know $q$, that ``here is one
hand''. Since he couldn't know this if the skeptical possibility were true, it
must be false.  He reverses the skeptical argument's \emph{modus ponens} into a
\emph{modus tollens} in a logical maneuver (apparently) now called a Moorean
Shift \cite{Preston}:
\begin{quote}
	(P1) If I don't know that not-$H$, then I don't know that $CS$ \\
	(P2) I knows that $CS$ \\
	$\therefore$ not-$H$
	\vspace{6pt} \\
	where: \\
	I am G. E. Moore \\
	$H$ is any skeptical possibility which denies the external world \\
	$CS$ is ``here is one hand''
\end{quote}
Or, formally:
\begin{quote}
	(P1) $\neg$P $\to~\neg$Q \\
	(P2) Q \\
	$\therefore$ P
\end{quote}
This is the argument to which \citeA{Wittgenstein69} responds in \emph{On
Certainty}.

Wittgenstein concedes that \emph{if} Moore does know that \emph{here is one
hand}, the argument is sound (\S 1). However, he is not convinced as Moore is,
that this proposition is certain simply from its \emph{seeming} true.

Wittgenstein asks whether ``it can make sense to doubt'' (\S 2) a proposition
like `here is one hand.' Outside of philosophy, we would never think to do such
a ridiculous thing as doubt the existence of our own hands.\footnote{And,
indeed, non-philosophy majors to whom I've talked about this paper were
surprised and somewhat confused that this was even a topic up for debate.}
It also seems that this doubt is not the same as our ordinary doubts. If I
doubt whether or not there `there's a hand here', I might be told to ``Look
closer'' (\S 3). The possibility of satisfaction, on Wittgenstein's view, is a
part of our language game of doubt. But the skeptic's doubt cannot be satisfied
by looking harder, or at all within this language game.

Like this `doubt' is not the same as our ordinary use of `doubt' in everyday
language games, `knowing' for Moore is different from our ordinary `knowing.' I
would never say that I \emph{know} that I have a hand. It cannot make sense for
me to doubt this, so it would never make sense for me to say I know it. That,
however, does not mean that I `do not know' that I have a hand. It means that
these assertions are nonsense (\S 10). They, if I understand correctly, fall
outside our language games, outside our grammar of `knowing.'
% Wittgenstein explores the boundaries of our language games surrounding
% knowledge at some length, 

In \S\S 57-59, Wittgenstein further discusses the grammar of ``I know,''
making a distinction between knowing and surmising. For him, ``I know'' is in
some sense equivalent to ``There is no such thing as a doubt in this case'' (\S
58). If the grammar of ``I know'' is conceived of in this way, it does not (and
cannot) matter who utters ``I know...''; it cannot be contingent on the
speaker. ``I know'' is then ``a logical insight'' (\S 59), a statement about
the world rather than about our convictions. However, this sort of statement,
on his view, cannot be used to prove realism (\S 59).  This seems to be a
direct rejection of Moore's \emph{modus tollens}, asserting that such
statements cannot prove realism at all.\footnote{I am not completely sure what,
in particular, motivates this rejection. I am not sure whether it is his
conviction that Moore's argumentation is a misapplication of the language games
of knowing, or that ``I know'' is a hypothesis in need of some sort of testing
(\S 60?). Either seems plausible to motivate such a rejection.}

% In \S 37, Wittgenstein performs the ``Russellian Retreat,'' admitting that he
% cannot prove the negation of the skeptical hypothesis.

% Talk about ordinary uses.

In his addition to rejecting Moore's argument Wittgenstein admits that the
skeptical hypothesis is ``not nonsense'' (\S 37), arguably inhabiting the
position \citeA{Wright91} calls the ``Russellian Retreat,'' of admitting that
we cannot prove the existence of an external world \cite{Robinson}.  However,
unlike \citeA{Russell12}, Wittgenstein does not give an account of knowing
which appeals to evidence or likelihood.  Instead, Wittgenstein takes as his
starting point that some propositions are exempt from doubt (\S 341). It is not
that they are any less worthy of being doubted, or that they are in some way
less susceptible to the skeptic's argumentation. Rather, we are not capable of
doubting them. We cannot avoid our conviction that they are true, and,
moreover, even if we were to doubt them in some philosophical sense, we would
still \emph{act} as if we held them true.  (If I, as a skeptic, doubted my
hands, I would still use them to write my doubts.) This acting, Wittgenstein
claims, lies at the bottom of the language game (\S 204).\footnote{But at the
bottom of which language game? Of certainty?  Of ``knowing''? All language
games?}
Even to `doubt,' there are things I must hold certain (\S 115) to construct the
language games of doubt. Without the language game ``[I] would not get as far
as doubting anything,'' (\S 115), and if you could somehow doubt privately,
``how [could] I know that someone is in doubt'' without some presuppositions?

On his view, these propositions ``stay put'' (\S 343) and act as a hinge on
which other propositions (\S 341), other doubts, other disputes (\S 655), and
our very lives (\S 344) turn (if those things are to function, which they do).
It is impossible, as he points out, to play chess without accepting that the
pieces are not moving without one's noticing (\S 346), let alone without
accepting the existence of an external world. These things form the
``starting-point'' (\S 209) for the chess game, which must be fixed for the
players to participate. Likewise, if my friend tells me he has certain tree
buds in New York (\S 208) and I am convinced, I must also hold that his tree
exists, that the earth exists...
Moore, then, (on Wittgenstein's view) when he says he `knows' that \emph{there
exists an external world} on the basis of his certainty that \emph{here is one
hand} is expressing that the existence of an external world is a hinge (or set
of hinges), which must stay put, on which his certainty about his hands turns
(\S 136).

Wittgenstein seems to hold that we cannot act as if these hinge propositions
were false nor truly hold them to be false. This avoids giving into radical
skepticism. However, I am not sure how this is a satisfying alternative.

% Quotes to incorporate:
% \begin{quote}
% 	\S 165. One child might say to another: ``I know that the earth is already
% 	hundred of years old'' and that would mean: I have learnt it.

% 	\S 344. My life consists in my being content to accept many things.

% 	\S 626. Nor does it mean anything to say: ``The English name of this colour
% 	is certainly `green', - unless, of course, I am making a slip of the tongue
% 	or am confused in some way.''

% 	\S 633. ``I can't be making a mistake'' - but what if I did make a mistake then,
% 	after all? For isn't that possible? But does that make the expression ``I
% 	can't be etc.'' nonsense? Or would it be better to say instead ``I can
% 	hardly be mistaken''? No; for that means something else.

% 	\S 669 The sentence ``I can't be making a mistake'' is certainly used in
% 	practice. But we may question whether it is then to be taken in a perfectly
% 	rigorous sense, or is rather a kind of exaggeration which perhaps is used
% 	only with a view to persuasion.

% 	\S 3.  If e.g. someone says ``I don't know if there's a hand here'' he
% 	might be told ``Look closer''.  --- This possibility of satisfying oneself
% 	is part of the language-game.  It is one of its essential features.

% 	\S 10. I know that a sick man is lying here?  Nonsense! (...) So I don't
% 	know, then, that there is a sick man lying here?  Neither the question nor
% 	the assertion makes any sense.

% 	\S 24. The idealist's question would be something like: ``What right have I
% 	not to doubt the existence of my hands?'' (And to that the answer can't be:
% 	I know that they exist.) But someone who asks such a question is
% 	overlooking the fact that a doubt about existence only works in a
% 	language-game.  Hence, that we should first have to ask: what would such a
% 	doubt be like?, and don't understand this straight off.

% 	\S 56. And everything descriptive of a language-game is part of logic.

% 	\S 59.  ``I know'' is here a logical insight.  Only realism can't be proved
% 	by means of it.

% 	\S 87. Can't an assertoric sentence, which was capable of functioning as an
% 	hypothesis, also be used as a foundation for research and action?  I.e.,
% 	can't it simply be isolated from doubt, though not according to any
% 	explicit rule?  It simply gets assumed as a truism, never called in
% 	question, perhaps not even ever formulated?

% 	\S 105. All testing, all confirmation and disconfirmation of a hypothesis
% 	takes place already within a system.  And this system is not a more or less
% 	arbitrary and doubtful point of departure for all our arguments: no, it
% 	belongs to the essence of what we call an argument. The system is not so
% 	much the point of departure, as the element in which arguments have their
% 	life.

% 	\S 114. If you are not certain of any fact, you cannot be certain ofo the
% 	meaning of your words either.

% 	\S 115. If you tried to doubt everything you would not get as far as
% 	doubting anything.  The game of doubting itself presupposes certainty.  

% 	\S 127.  For how do I know that someone is in doubt?  How do I know that he
% 	uses the words ``I doubt it'' as I do?

% 	\S\S 151 - 152.  I should like to say: Moore does not know what he asserts
% 	he knows, but it stands fast for him, as also for me; regarding it as
% 	absolutely solid is part of our method of doubt and enquiry.  I do not
% 	explicitly learn the propositions that stand fast for me.  I can discover
% 	them subsequently like the axis around which a body rotates.  This axis is
% 	not fixed in the sense that anything holds it fast, but the movement around
% 	it determines its immobility.   \emph{cf.} \S\S~109, 110, 141, 142, 213

% 	\S 204.  Giving grounds, however, justifying the evidence, comes to an end;
% 	--- but the end is not certain propositions' striking us immediately as
% 	true, i.e. it is not a kind of seeing on our part; it is our acting, which
% 	lies at the bottom of the language-game.

% 	\S 341. [T]he questions that we raise and our doubts depend on the fact
% 	that some propositions are exempt from doubt, are as it were like hinges on
% 	which those turn.

% 	\S\S 358 - 359.  Now I would like to regard this certainty ... as a form of
% 	life.  But that means I want to conceive it as something that lies beyond
% 	being justified or unjustified; as it were, as something animal.

% 	\S 166.  The difficulty is to realize the groundlessness of our believing.  

% 	\S 455.  Every language-game is based on words and `objects' being
% 	recognized again.  We learn with the same inexorability that this is a
% 	chair as that 2 x 2 = 4.  

% 	\S 527.  An Englishman who calls this color ``red'' is not `sure it is
% 	called ``red'' in English'. A child who has mastered the use of the word is
% 	not `sure that in his language this color is called...'.  Nor can one say
% 	of him that when he is learning to speak he learns that the color is called
% 	that in English; nor yet: he knows this when he has learned the use of the
% 	word.  (...) And in spite of this ... one child, for example, will say, of
% 	another or of himself, that he already knows what such-and-such is called.

% 	\S 538.  The child, I should like to say, learns to react in such-and-such
% 	a way; and in so reacting doesn't so far know anything.  Knowing only
% 	begins at a later level.
