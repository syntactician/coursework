\begin{verse}
	I've had enough \\
	I'm sick of seeing and touching \\
	Both sides of things \\
	Sick of being the damn bridge for everybody
\end{verse}

\begin{verse}
	Nobody \\
	Can talk to anybody \\
	Without me \\
	Right?
\end{verse}

\begin{verse}
	I explain my mother to my father my father to my little sister \\
	My little sister to my brother my brother to the white feminists \\
	The white feminists to the Black church folks the Black church folks \\
	To the ex-hippies the ex-hippies to the Black separatists the \\
	Black separatists to the artists the artists to my friends' parents
\end{verse}

\begin{verse}
	Then \\
	I've got to explain myself \\
	To everybody
\end{verse}

\begin{verse}
	I do more translating \\
	Than the Gawdamn U.N.
\end{verse}

\begin{verse}
	Forget it \\
	I'm sick of it
\end{verse}

\begin{verse}
	I'm sick of filling in your gaps
\end{verse}

\begin{verse}
	Sick of being your insurance against \\
	The isolation of self-imposed limitations \\
	Sick of being the crazy at your holiday dinners \\
	Sick of being the odd one at your Sunday Brunches \\
	Sick of being the sole Black friend to 34 individual white people
\end{verse}

\begin{verse}
	Find another connection to the rest of the world \\
	Find something else to make you legitimate \\
	Find some other way to be political and hip
\end{verse}

\begin{verse}
	I will not be the bridge to your womanhood \\
	Your manhood \\
	Your human-ness
\end{verse}

\begin{verse}
	I'm sick of reminding you not to \\
	Close off too tight for too long
\end{verse}

\begin{verse}
	I'm sick of mediating with your worst self \\
	On behalf of your better selves
\end{verse}

\begin{verse}
	I am sick \\
	Of having to remind you \\
	To breathe \\
	Before you suffocate \\
	Your own fool self
\end{verse}

\begin{verse}
	Forget it \\
	Stretch or drown \\
	Evolve or die
\end{verse}

\begin{verse}
	The bridge I must be \\
	Is the bridge to my own power \\
	I must translate \\
	My own fears \\
	Mediate \\
	My own weaknesses
\end{verse}

\begin{verse}
	I must be the bridge to nowhere \\
	But my true self \\
	And then \\
	I will be useful
\end{verse}
