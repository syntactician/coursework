Lewis & Elman (2001)

### What are two things that you learned from this reading?

-   I realized Chomskyan linguists were against statistical modeling to
    explain language acquisition, and I had not given any thought to an
    account which allows for learning to leverage statistical
    regularities without completely undermining the UG hypothesis. I
    think the introduction of this piece makes a good case for the
    possibility of such a compatibilist account.
-   I think the argument for negative evidence was relatively convincing,
	and was one I hadn't really considered before. If I form a false
	hypothesis, negative evidence abounds. It is only in the case that
	I form only true hypotheses (which is surely a fringe case, if it
	exists) that I receive no negative evidence.

### What challenges does the reading face?

-   The register is relatively impenetrable. There were some sections I
    had to re-read upwards of five times to get any idea of what was
    being said. I have to imagine that this paper could have been
    written to be much more accessible.
-   Along the same lines, I think that a non-technical (or, as
	non-technical as possible) conceptual account of what an SRN *is* and
	what it does should have been given. Not all linguists are computer
	scientists, and not all computer scientists work with SRNs. That
	shouldn't disqualify us from understanding this work.

### What are two things that you did not understand in the reading?

-   I have no idea what a localist representation is or how it's
    important that one was used. I'm also not quite sure where to start
    in the literature to figure it out.
-   Why is predicting the grammatical category of the next word in the
    input the goal (or even a measure of success)? Shouldn't prediction
    of *aux*-questions have something to do with a hierarchical
    representation of language, *even* if the learning process is
    probabilistic?
