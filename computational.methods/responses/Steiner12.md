Steiner (2012)

### What are two things that you learned from this reading?

-   The history of algorithms was useful for me. Most of my
    understanding of the history of mathematics comes from a course in
    the history of (astro)physics and cosmology, so this reading filled
    in a lot of gaps.
-   I had never heard of Emmy or Emily Howell. Both are fascinating
    projects, and Howell's compositions are quite good.

### What challenges does the reading face?

-   I think the first chapter spent too little time on
    Boole(an functions) and logic gates. It barely explains the
    theoretical importance of these gates, and does even less to explain
    how they function (either in algorithms or in devices).
-   I personally think the music chapter spent a lot of time on the
    effects of such technology on the music industry (and the reactions
    that people have to it) and not enough on the mechanics of
    the technology. I have very little idea how McCready's algorithm
    actually characterizes music, or how Emmy works. Are they machine
    learning projects? Are they something else? I don't have enough
    information about what exactly they do.

### What are two things that you did not understand in the reading?

-   I understand very little about graph theory, and even less about why
    it is included in the chapter. What should I understand about it
    from this reading?
-   I don't understand what sort of function(s) comprise "the last
    strand of \[Emmy's\] DNA" (p. 94). Steiner describes "loops and
    random functions that would maintain patterns and structure . . .
    until unexpectedly breaking rhythm to lend the spark of an advanced
    human composer" (p. 94). "Random functions" is a horrible
    description, and it's unclear to me what exactly this would do or
    how it would "\[capture\] the spirit of someone as brilliant as
    Johann Sebastian Bach" (p. 94). Until this point, Emmy sounded like
    an exercise in machine learning, but this sounds like
    something else.
