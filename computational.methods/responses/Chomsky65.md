Chomsky (1965)
==============

### What are two things that you learned from this reading?

-   I got a definition of formatives ("minimal syntactically functional
    units"), which I've seen in papers before, but hadn't seen defined
    this concisely.
-   I found out that Chomsky's "systematic ambiguity" (p. 25) -- between
    a child's understanding and a linguists' account of it --
    was intentional.

### What challenges does the reading face?

-   I am dubious of Chomsky's idealized world, in which a perfect
    speaker-listener exists in a perfectly homogeneous speech community.
    While I understand the appeal of idealizing the subject of
    linguistics, I think that such idealization presents relatively
    fundamental problems, in that it prevents us from understanding
    language as it actually functions in the world.
-   This reading assumes that all readers are already with the
    literature which supports it. It seems to me that a work of this
    length could afford to give at least a gestural account of this
    literature, which would help immensely with readability.

### What are two things that you did not understand in the reading?

-   I don't fully understand why these arguments necessitate
    Universal Grammar.
-   I'm confused about his benchmarks for explanatory adequacy. Why
    these things and not other things?
