Marr (1982)

### What are two things that you learned from this reading?

-   I had never conceptualized *processes* as being divisible in the way
    Marr divides them.
-   I finally grasped the philosophical debate about the existence of
    sense-data!

### What challenges does the reading face?

-   I think Marr to easily dismisses concerns about the purpose of
    human vision. It is clearly necessary to appeal to mating behavior
    to explain every level of jumping spiders' vision systems. It is
    necessary to appeal to a fly's other behaviors (flying,
    landing, etc.) to investigate its vision processes. To say that
    human vision is "more general" (p. 76) is insufficient to establish
    that the purpose of human vision is to "describe" (p. 78).
-   Similarly, I lack Marr's certainty that "vision alone can deliver an
    internal description of the shape of a viewed object" (p. 78). Why
    should we prefer this account over one in which vision is a process
    of categorizing viewed objects, or describing regions of pixels, or
    of making either available as input to other processes. Choosing
    this description of vision as a process may beg the question.

### What are two things that you did not understand in the reading?

-   I understood very little of the math. The particulars of the
    discussion of fly behavior ($\psi$?) went entirely over my head.
-   The "representational framework" discussed in Table 5.2 goes
    entirely over my head.
