### What are two things that you learned from this reading?

-   I was not at all familiar with the history of the Phanariots.
    Tracing the history of the notion of linguistic "fidelity" was
    informative and engaging.
-   I did not really have a sense for how people working in machine
    translation regarded human translators (or vice versa). This is a
    great primer on their relationship.

### What challenges does the reading face?

-   The reading seems overly dismissive of the idea that the "gist" is
    separable from the "style." While the author is correct that this is
    an oversimplification, it seems to be a strategic one, and one of
    some practical value. Relating the gist is arguably better than
    relating nothing, and Google Translate has been put to good use by a
    great many people.
-   The article neglects to tell us the fate of the old, cryptographic
    model of translation. Is anyone still working on it? Are parallel
    texts the only current approach?

### What are two things that you did not understand in the reading?

-   I'm curious about the assumptions inherent in the parallel
    text(s) model. It seems that if we allow the translator to learn on
    a parallel text, we have to tacitly trust the work of the
    human translator(s) who produced it. Are parallel texts vetted? Are
    there criteria?
-   [A reddit
    thread](https://reddit.com/r/TranslationStudies/comments/3ca6ql/is_translation_an_art_or_a_math_problem_ny_times/)
    about this article brings up an interesting point: no translation
    performed by humans (even technical translation) is purely
    mathematical or deterministic. Translators still adjust for
    intended audience. What audiences are the parallel texts intended
    for? What register does this grant to machine translated documents?
