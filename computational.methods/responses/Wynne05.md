### What are two things that you learned from this reading?

-   I didn't realize that the Brown corpus was in any way normative (. I
    always assumed corpora were by nature descriptive. I'm going to read
    up more on its history.
-   I hadn't heard of ToBI (or INTSINT or TSM). I had only POS tagging,
    syntactic annotation, and discourse annotation before, and I didn't
    realize that corpora included prosidic annotation.

### What challenges does the reading face?

-   The definition which should have guided the discussion of the first
    chapter is instead presented as resultant from it.
-   The text varies wildly in its level of technical detail. In Ch. 2 it
    goes into specific limitations of SGML/XML, while just a chapter
    earlier it assumes the reader is unfamiliar with metadata
    (\S 2.2.5).
-   Apart from occasional technological tangents, I feel that Ch. 2 is
    too general. The texts purports to be a "guide to good practice,"
    but it spends more time enumerating possible courses of action than
    it does advising on which of those courses of action are "good
    practice."

### What are two things that you did not understand in the reading?

-   I don't understand why Sinclair takes a principled stance against
    annotation, or why these chapters appear in the same volume given
    the inherent disagreement between the camps of their authors.
-   I don't understand the nature of the 'Brown Family' corpus
    annotations, which seem to still be a *de facto* standard. I need to
    read up more.
