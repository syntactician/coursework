### What are two things that you learned from this reading?

-   This is an application of data-mining that I hadn't even considered.
    I think about textual analysis from an academic standpoint --- not
    usually a practical one.
-   I also hadn't though of this sort of forum as a possible source
    for corpora. Now that I think about it, they seem like they'd be
    quite useful for topical corpora.

### What challenges does the reading face?

-   Kraft doesn't adequately discuss the process of flagging
    smoke words. "Mechanical engineer\[s\] . . . analyzed and
    categorized a sample of those comments" really doesn't cut it.
-   The piece also seems to assume that Honda et al. don't already have
    a way of extracting this data (that this research is needed to
    access otherwise/previously unknown data). It's equally possible
    that these companies have systems already, but don't act (due to
    costs, etc.).

### What are two things that you did not understand in the reading?

-   "\[T\]ext-analytics algorithms were used to identify smoke-word
    markers." Does this mean they identified traits of smoke words, and
    are able to predict novel smoke words? I'd be really interested in
    more information.
-   How do they filter out cases of driver error? I hear a lot of people
    complain about "product defects" that are really failures to use a
    product correctly. This seems like it would be a big problem.
