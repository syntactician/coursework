### What are two things that you learned from this reading?

-   I didn't know about the successful NASA/Google test of the D-Wave
    chip! That's exciting!
-   I wasn't familiar with the literature on "deep learning." I'm
    excited to dive into that.

### What challenges does the reading face?

-   This piece doesn't do nearly enough to explain how quantum computers
    work or why it is that they would be particularly better than more
    conventional supercomputers. How can entanglement "allow a single
    operation in a quantum computer to do the work of many, many more
    operations in a conventional computer" (Dream maker section, para.
    7)? Why would we want an annealer that can perform only one
    algorithm? Why would 100 high quality qubits be better than 1097 low
    quality ones? This doesn't tell me.
-   Martinis may be "tall with a loud, friendly voice" (Dream maker
    section, para. 5), but that doesn't tell me much about his computer.
    I think this piece should have stayed considerably more focused.

### What are two things that you did not understand in the reading?

-   I don't really understand how superposition is used in computation.
    Is the math still binary? Is it trinary, now that there is a third
    bit state? Is superposition truly a third possible state of the bit,
    or is that an oversimplification?
-   What is deep learning and how is it substantively different than
    other machine leaning? Why do we need specifically quantum computers
    for it? Does it need a universal computer, or can it be done on an
    annealer (or series of annealers)?
