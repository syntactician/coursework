To start, I'm going to import the modules and data that I need.  I'm importing
the nltk tools individually for two reasons: to reduce load times, and to give
me access to these functions directly, instead of calling them as, for example
\texttt{nltk.ConditionalFreqDist()}, which gets quite unwieldy.

<<import>>=
from nltk import FreqDist
from nltk import ConditionalFreqDist
from nltk import RegexpTagger
from nltk.corpus import brown
