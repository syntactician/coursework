# Computational Methods in Language Science — Dan Parker
### Spring 2016 — Linguistics 380

#### Course Description
If a computer is smart en ough to beat humans at Jeopardy, drive a car,
and pen a haiku, does it mean that machines can think? Is it possible to
predict the spread of the flu, or the success of Hollywood’s next film
based on patterns in Google searches? Did Shakespeare really write that
sonnet?

Scientists use patterns in language to answer these questions, using the
same concepts that underlie everyday applications like search engines,
automatic translators, speech recognition systems, spell checkers, and
auto-correction tools. This course takes you on a tour of these
applications, focusing on the  technological  ideas  behind  them, through
a  combination  of  seminar-style  discussions  and practical hands-on
projects.

Since this course is a linguistics course, we take seriously the goals of
linguistic inquiry – to uncover the structures of human language and the
mental mechanisms for language understanding. In this course, w e will
achieve this goal in a novel way, by taking a reflective, analytic, an
d hands-on approach to study how computers use and support language. Over
the course of the semester , we will see that by looking at how different
technologies succeed and fail at human language understanding, and by
examining the ways in which their behavior diverges from that of a human,
we can learn gain new insights about the human linguistic system
