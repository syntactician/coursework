The word "wade" only occurs two times in the text: when Julian and Velmyra wade in the creek, and in the title of Julian's album. When they wade in the creek, it is a communal activity, and they are returning to each other. Wading Home is also the title of Julian's album, where it gives a name to the experiences he has throughout the course of the novel. It is his coming-to-terms with the tragedy, and his success through it. Home has almost countless meanings. In Chapter 1 alone, home is where you live, where you can't be driven from by a storm, where friends are, where people speak like you, where you have to return. To Julian, it also means the South, Silver Creek specifically, family, and the feeling of playing music from the soul. It means where we are comfortable or where we are compelled to be. It means not only where we live, but where our heritage lives.
