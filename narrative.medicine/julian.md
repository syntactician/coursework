Julian's injury setting back his career is a familiar story to many ill people. Many who acquire injuries or illness later in life experience this frustration, this devastation that Julian feels. I was a good soccer player. I played high school varsity (albeit in a small district) in 8th grade. But I couldn't continue because I kept breaking bones, and my back and knees started to deteriorate. My partner is a massage therapist with a degenerative disease that affects the hands. This story is all too common, and it is devastating each time. To read about Julian, in the position he's in, I know he's not emotionally in a place to handle Katrina --- not that anyone ever could be. He is already off balance, already reeling from other events. He is not at all over his split with Velmyra, or his injury. He is not set for more trouble, but "life did not stop." Yet he survives, and thrives, by maintaining and strengthening his ties to his family, his community, his home.
