# Medicine, Arts and Social Justice — Joanne M. Braxton
### Fall 2015 — Africana Studies 306 (American Studies 350; Asian and Middle Eastern Studies 350)

### Course Description
This course addresses issues of health equity and originates in Africana
Studies. It has been developed as part of the W&M-Eastern Virginia Medical
School Narrative Medicine for Excellence Project. “Medicine, Arts and Social
Justice” is for those who crave diversity and intellectual stimulation in a
classroom setting that is authentically multi-disciplinary and inter-cultural.
It is for artists seeking careers that overlap with the healing arts as well as
pre-med types who love stories, especially stories from the experiences of
African, Asian-American and African-American people. It is for scholars of
Ethics and/or Religious Studies exploring careers they haven't fully imagined
yet. It is for scientists who want to discover how literature can inform
methodology, for folks who are ready to be creative and to think and play
outside the box. It is for inquiring minds seeking solutions to health problems
that plague our diverse and varied communities and who want to be in
conversation with other like-minded people grappling with similar theoretical
and practical problems.
