Sylvia ties the novel together. She's close to Simon, but also knows Julian well and is tight with Velmyra. She is kind and loving, and performs gentle, healing femininity at the heart of the work, tying its other characters together. She is "motherly," "warm," and "nurturing" by "nature," filling the gap in Juian's life left by his mother. She similarly heals Simon after Ladeena's death, essentially nursing him back to the will to live. She also, mother-like, orchestrates the actions of others, giving them advice and helping them do what they must. She urges Julian to deal with Parmenter, despite his feelings about him. Despite this motherlyness, she does not fill the traditional, normative female roles of wife and mother. She is not Julian's mother, or a direct surrogate. She is constantly referred to as his father's friend, and their social standing is such that he uses her first name. She does not marry Simon, though the possibility is open, because she does not see a need to change things, to fill that role. She shows us the strength of femininity to heal, without succumbing to the societal pressures which accompany womanhood and femininity.
