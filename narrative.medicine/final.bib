@article{Sullivan95,
	Abstract = {Cognitive-behavioral pain psychology views pain as an immediate and private subjective experience. But close examination reveals the notion of a completely private pain sensation to be unintelligible. Using arguments developed by Ludwig Wittgenstein concerning the relation between pain and language, the author contends that pain experience, as well as pain expression, is mediated by the conceptual structure of our common language. As conceptual, pain remains subjective but becomes an essentially social phenomenon. This implies changes in understanding of the relations between respondent and operant pain behavior, pain and pain behavior, and pain and suffering. The author proposes that if we accept that human pain experience occurs within language, then we must reject the ``event-interpretation'' model of pain experience offered by cognitive-behavioral pain psychology in favor of one that recognizes the primacy of narrative construction.},
