\section{(Non)Metalinguistic Twin
Earth}\label{nonmetalinguistic-twin-earth}

\subsection{3 December}\label{december}

Ordinary metalinguistic and metapragmatic remarks have typically been
treated as epiphenomenal -- trivial and supplementary add-ons to the
real business of language: something like customized user-friendly
interfaces with which different cultures over-lay the underlying
linguistic operating system. So, imagine a Twin Earth which has the
following characteristics: the only language spoken on Twin Earth is
identical with English as spoken on Earth, except that the language
provides no means of saying anything metalinguistic or metapragmatic.
So, although Twin Earthlings produce words and utterances that sound
exactly like the English words and sentences produced on Earth and
although they appear to understand these words and sentences as
English-speaking Earthlings do, nonetheless, Twin-Earthlings have no way
of speaking about the language---its component sounds, words, phrases,
and meanings---or about particular utterances that anyone makes in the
language.

For example, they cannot say such things as:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  ``That's what she said''
\item
  ``What did he mean by that, anyway?''
\item
  ``I'm talking about the one on the left''
\item
  ``Sorry, could you say that again?''
\item
  ``Did she understand what you said?''
\item
  ``What does comely mean?''
\item
  ``That's not true!''
\item
  ``Yes, that's right.''
\item
  ``Why did he say that?''
\item
  ``Will you explain that?''
\item
  ``What's that called?''
\item
  ``Is this what you're referring to?''
\item
  ``I'll try to describe it to you.''
\item
  ``I don't agree with that remark.''
\item
  ``What's his name?''
\item
  ``No, soporific doesn't mean childish''
\item
	``{[}ikanam\textipa{I}ks{]} and {[}\textipa{E}kanam\textipa{I}ks{]} are the same word''
\item
  ``I'm only teasing''
\item
  ``Do you understand?''
\item
  ``That's not what I told you to do''
\item
  ``Please don't lie to me.''
\end{itemize}

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  How would communicational life on Twin Earth be different from
  familiar aspects of Anglophone communicational life on Earth?
  Consider, for instance, the following familiar practices.

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    having an argument with your roommate
  \item
    making an agreement with someone
  \item
    saying someone's name
  \item
    reading and writing
  \item
    doing arithmetic
  \item
    following orders
  \item
    making a promise
  \item
    learning language (i.e., by a child)
  \item
    playing games (e.g., soccer or checkers)
  \item
    making or enforcing laws
  \item
    getting married
  \item
    making and testing predictions
  \item
    explaining your reasoning
  \item
    planning for the future
  \item
    teaching a child how to behave
  \item
    working with someone to complete a complex task
  \end{itemize}
\item
  In what ways would Twin Earth social and cultural life be different
  from that on Earth?
\end{enumerate}
