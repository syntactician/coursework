Lucy on Quotatives in Yucatec Maya
==================================
12 November
-----------

1.  Be prepared to give examples of metalinguistic speech in a language
    or languages with which you’re familiar:

    -   one example in which the metalanguage and the object language
        are the same.

    -   one in which the metalanguage and the object language are
        different (or different varieties of the same language).

2.  Think of examples of quotatives:

    -   at least one “direct” quotative

    -   at least one “indirect” quotative

        -   be ready to explain what about it is indirect, how it
            functions

    -   reflect on “blend<span>\[</span>ing<span>\]</span>” of the two
        extremes

    -   find the examples in the text (read footnote 1)

3.  Be prepared to discuss the use of kih to report non-linguistic
    occurrences, and draw parallels to quotatives with which
    you’re familiar. (–rephrase, split into two?)

    -   (go like, be like, is like, etc)

4.  What are some contrasting ways of reporting speech? (ie fully
    reflexive, degeneratively reflexive, etc. page 94)

5.  Summarize the story and the significance of the quotative forms.
    (have a couple people do each section)

    -   focus on two different usages of kih in the story (local
        discourse function vs global)

6.  Explain some limitations of the data or methods used in the paper.
