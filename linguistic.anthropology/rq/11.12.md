Lucy on Quotatives in Yucatec Maya
==================================

12 November
-----------

1.  Think of examples of metalinguistic speech in a language or
    languages with which you’re familiar:

    -   one example in which the metalanguage and the object language
        are the same.

    -   one in which the metalanguage and the object language are
        different (or different varieties of the same language).

2.  Think of examples of quotatives:

    -   at least one “direct” quotative

    -   at least one “indirect” quotative

        -   be ready to explain what about it is indirect, how it
            functions reflect on
            “blend<span>\[</span>ing<span>\]</span>” of direct and
            indirect

    -   find the examples in the text (be sure to read footnote 1)

3.  How does ki- function, morpho-syntactically?

4.  Be prepared to discuss the use of kih to report non-linguistic
    occurrences, and draw parallels to quotatives with which
    you’re familiar. (–rephrase, split into two?)

5.  What are some contrasting ways of reporting speech? (ie fully
    reflexive, degeneratively reflexive, etc. page 94)

6.  Summarize the story and the significance of the quotative forms.

    -   focus on two different usages of kih in the story (local
        discourse function vs global)

    -   think about the speech norms on which the story relies

7.  Explain some limitations of the data or methods used in the paper.
