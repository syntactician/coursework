Lucy on Quotatives in Yucatec Maya
==================================

12 November
-----------

1.  Think of examples of metalinguistic speech in a language or
    languages with which you’re familiar

    -   one example in which the metalanguage and the object language
        are the same

    -   one in which the metalanguage and the object language are
        different (or different varieties of the same language)

2.  Think of examples of report form in a language with which you are
    familiar

    -   at least one “direct” report form

    -   at least one “indirect” report form

        -   be ready to explain what about it is indirect, how it
            functions

    -   in what ways can there be
        “blend<span><span><span>\[</span></span></span>ing<span><span><span>\]</span></span></span>”
        of direct and indirect

    -   find the examples in the text (be sure to read footnote 1)

3.  How does ki- function, morpho-syntactically?

4.  Be prepared to discuss the use of kih to report non-linguistic
    occurrences, and draw parallels to quotatives with which you’re
    familiar

5.  What are some contrasting ways of reporting speech? (ie fully
    reflexive, degeneratively reflexive, etc. page 94)

6.  Summarize the story and the significance therein of the quotative
    forms:

    -   What are the speech norms on which the story relies?

    -   Please explain each of the two different ways that kih is used
        in the story

        -   local discourse function

        -   global function.

7.  Discuss the strengths and limitations of the data and/or methods
    used in the paper
