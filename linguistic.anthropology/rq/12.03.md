(Non)Metalinguistic Twin Earth
==============================

3 December
----------

Ordinary metalinguistic and metapragmatic remarks have typically been
treated as epiphenomenal -- trivial and supplementary add-ons to the
real business of language: something like customized user-friendly
interfaces with which different cultures over-lay the underlying
linguistic operating system. So, imagine a Twin Earth which has the
following characteristics: the only language spoken on Twin Earth is
identical with English as spoken on Earth, except that the language
provides no means of saying anything metalinguistic or metapragmatic.
So, although Twin Earthlings produce words and utterances that sound
exactly like the English words and sentences produced on Earth and
although they appear to understand these words and sentences as
English-speaking Earthlings do, nonetheless, Twin-Earthlings have no way
of speaking about the language—its component sounds, words, phrases, and
meanings—or about particular utterances that anyone makes in the
language.

For example, they cannot say such things as:

-   “That’s what she said”
-   "What did he mean by that, anyway?"
-   “I’m talking about the one on the left”
-   “Sorry, could you say that again?”
-   “Did she understand what you said?”
-   “What does comely mean?”
-   “That’s not true!”
-   “Yes, that’s right.”
-   “Why did he say that?”
-   “Will you explain that?”
-   “What’s that called?”
-   “Is this what you’re referring to?”
-   “I’ll try to describe it to you.”
-   “I don’t agree with that remark.”
-   “What’s his name?”
-   “No, soporific doesn’t mean childish”
-   “\[ikanamɪks\] and \[ɛkanamɪks\] are the same word”
-   “I’m only teasing”
-   “Do you understand?”
-   “That’s not what I told you to do”
-   “Please don’t lie to me.”

1.  How would communicational life on Twin Earth be different from
    familiar aspects of Anglophone communicational life on Earth?
    Consider, for instance, the following familiar practices.
    -   having an argument with your roommate
    -   making an agreement with someone
    -   saying someone’s name
    -   reading and writing
    -   doing arithmetic
    -   following orders
    -   making a promise
    -   learning language (i.e., by a child)
    -   playing games (e.g., soccer or checkers)
    -   making or enforcing laws
    -   getting married
    -   making and testing predictions
    -   explaining your reasoning
    -   planning for the future
    -   teaching a child how to behave
    -   working with someone to complete a complex task

2.  In what ways would Twin Earth social and cultural life be different
    from that on Earth?
