Greetings and the Normal Course of Action
=========================================

15 October
----------

The reading for this class is about the normativity of cultural
behavior. People regularly (if not always) reproduce in fine detail the
behavioral (including linguistic) patterns of their languaculture, day
in and day out. Why? The sociologist Harold Garfinkel addressed this
question in his works on ethnomethodology. The short extract about
greetings for today’s reading is from John Heritage’s book about
Garfinkel and ethnomethodology.

*“It is the reflexivity of the actors, their awareness of the options
together with their anticipation of some of the interpretations to which
their exercise of the options will give rise, which may ultimately keep
them on the rails of perceivedly normal/normatively-provided-for
conduct”.* (Heritage, Garfinkel and Ethnomethodology, p. 119)

1.  Why does a greeting inevitably place the person greeted in a
    ‘situation of choice’? What choices are available? What are the
    implications of each choice?

2.  What does Heritage mean by saying that the first greeter has
    ‘reflexively reconstituted the scene’? How does the first greeter do
    this? Does the respondent do the same?

3.  In what way are the ‘cognitive and the moral deeply entwined’ in
    this seemingly trivial interaction?
