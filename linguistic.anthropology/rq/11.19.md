1.  Do you have any memories or examples of your life when you were
    specifically taught how to act in a classroom setting? 2 How are
    Agha’s “speech chains” (97) related to socialization? / How is the
    “trajectory of socialization” defined? (98)

2.  How is the trajectory established? What does he mean by a “poetic
    structure” (98)

3.  All but one of the boys often refused to participate in class. What
    factors contribute to socialization? (102)

4.  How was Tyisha initially perceived by her peers and teacher? Why did
    this change?

5.  Explain Tyisha’s role as a “participant example.” How is it relevant
    to her trajectory of socialization? (105)

6.  How did Tyisha eventually become the beast? Explain what happens in
    each of the pieces of Tyisha’s story and how they fit together to
    show her fall.

7.  In the discussion about goals, two possible “interactional texts”
    are mentioned. What are they? How does Mrs. Bailey attempt to
    “entextualize” Tyisha’s argument? (108)

8.  Where can we find trajectories of socialization outside the
    classroom setting? Examples?

9.  Explain how the other students in the class affected Tyisha’s
    trajectory of socialization.
