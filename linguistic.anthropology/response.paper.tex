\maketitle



My parents both speak Spanish. My father grew up on both sides of the US-Mexico border, 
speaking exclusively Spanish in ethnically Mexican households. English is his second 
language, and he did not begin to learn it until he was required to in a United States 
elementary school. My mother grew up in an English-speaking family, learning Spanish 
only in classrooms. Both of them remain at least conversationally fluent. As a result, I 
grew up hearing multiple varieties of both English and Spanish at home.

Despite speaking Spanish to each other, neither of my parents made any sort of effort to 
speak it to me or teach it to me. I was never really fluent as a child; the best I could 
ever do was string a halting sentence or two together to greet my aunts and uncles when 
we visited. Eventually, they started speaking English to me as well, and I entirely lost 
all of my Spanish ability. At least, I thought I did. When I got to high school and took 
a Spanish class, it quickly became apparent that I knew more than I thought.

None of my friends really had a problem \say{learning Spanish} in the traditional sense. 
They learned the phonology, the vocabulary, and everything else in the textbook. But 
when it came to speaking conversationally, they had some issues that I never ran into. 
While my friends were struggling with word order, I got it right every time, not because 
I was a better student, but because I thought of adjectives as following nouns. I 
thought of love as a reflexive verb. Because I had a window into the culture behind the 
language, or at least into the manner of thinking which accompanied the use of the 
language, I was a step ahead. As my Spanish teacher put it, they were \say{speaking 
English with Spanish words} and I was speaking Spanish.

That is not to say that I am any sort of expert. I am not ever fluent, and what 
knowledge I have only really extends to particular Peninsular and Mexican varieties. One 
of my closest friends is a fluent bilingual speaker of English and Spanish. However, 
it\footnote{My friend is queer and prefers to be referred to using the pronoun 
\say{it.}} is from Argentina and speaks only castellano rioplatense and United Kingdom 
Standard English. When we first met, we communicated mostly in English, but we found 
that a lot of words had different meanings for us, especially newer words. Recently, I 
have been trying to learn more Spanish, and I have started speaking with it in Spanish. 
Nothing in my learning prepared me for the differences between Mexican and Argentinian 
Spanish. The second person pronouns are different and the concepts of respect and 
familiarity that dictate their use are completely unfamiliar to me. The vocabulary is 
full of Italian loanwords. If we didn't share a second language as well, it would be 
extremely hard for us to communicate. Even though I have academically \say{learned 
Spanish,} there is a huge disconnect between my learning and the competence(s) I need 
to communicate with other Spanish speakers from other cultures and dialects.
