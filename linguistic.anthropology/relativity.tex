\nocite{Crane90}

For clarity, a few key terms will be defined here, and their use throughout
this paper will not deviate from these definitions. \say{A language} will here
mean the a particular spoken or signed system of human communication which in
shared by a group of people who also share a culture.\footnote{By this
definition, most variations usually described as dialects are languages (e.g.
African American English is a language distinct from other variations of
English).} To \say{think} will here mean to form and use concepts or
categories, and will not concern such primitive cognitive events as sensory
perception itself. \say{Linguistic Relativity} is the claim that a speaker's
thought is influenced by the language which she speaks. The \say{weak} form of
this claim is simply that features of a speaker's particular language is
correlated
% …features….are correlated
with her thoughts. Neither of these claims is identical to \say{Linguistic
Determinism,} the claim that a speaker's language limits or determines her
thoughts.

Many linguists make the claim that Linguistic Relativity is true. 
% Actually, ‘in the Circle’ linguists (grammarians, phonologists) on the whole
% argue against it, whereas linguistic anthropologists and sociolinguists
% accept it.
They offer a variety of evidence. Evidence includes that speakers of Pirah\~{a}
do not speak of cardinal numbers, and they also have difficulty on tasks
requiring the transposition or recollection of numerosity \cite{Everett12}.
Similarly, the Guugu-Yimidhirr do not speak of egocentric directions like
\say{left} or \say{right,} but rather of cardinal directions like \say{north}
and \say{south,} regardless of scale \cite{Foley97}.\footnote{I'm not entirely
		sure this citation is correct, but I did the best I could based on the
excerpt I had.} Both Pirah\~{a} and Guugu-Yimidhirr appear to limit their
speakers to these modes of thought. Pirah\~{a} does not have lexical items
identical to numbers as we commonly understand them, and Guugu-Yimidhirr lacks
words for left and right. 
% And front and back.
Less extreme examples can be seen in other languages as well; for instance,
English lacks formality and number distinctions in the second person, while
Spanish has both. 
% Are you suggesting that there are differences in how English and Spanish
% speakers think that are the consequence of these linguistic differences in
% their 2nd person pronouns? Given where you have placed this remark, that
% would seem to be implied.  But if it is, then you should make the point
% explicitly.
This evidence in the literature makes it clear that speakers of different
languages do, in fact, think in different ways. It seems to suggest that these
ways of thinking are \textbf{caused} by the differences in the languages. The
argument is that Guugu-Yimdihirr lack the concepts of left and right due to
their absence in their language, and this causes them 
% …and, as the experimental evidence appears to show, this causes them….
to utilize instead their concepts of east and west.

While this seems like controvertible evidence, 
% I think you mean ‘incontrovertible’: impossible to deny.
it seems so only because the authors have begged the question. They have made
the claim that these differences in thought arise from the differences in the
language, rather than other differences. The Pirah\~{a} are hunter-gatherers in
an environment which largely does not require counting or numeration. A
proponent of Linguistic Relativity would claim that for the Pirahã, their
cultural lack of numeration tasks caused a lack of numeration terms in the
language, which causes Pirahã speakers to think in other terms. Likewise, the
utility of cardinal directions in open countryside caused Guugu-Yimidhirr to
develop as it is, and the language causes its speakers to think of direction
cardinally.
% Well put.

If this is the case, if differences in the language are truly what cause
differences in thought, then introducing speakers of Pirahã to words for
numbers might be sufficient to allow them to think of numerosity. Certainly
Pirah\~{a} who were exposed to Portuguese would have concepts of numbers, and
be able to employ them. However, \citeA{Gordon04} suggests that Pirah\~{a} who
have contact with Portuguese speakers and understand it to some degree do not
understand the embedded number words (p. 497), and \citeA{Everett12}, despite
attempting to supplement the Pirah\~{a} language with number words, were
largely unsuccessful at training the Pirah\~{a} to transpose or remember
numbers. 
% E&M only administered the quantity-matching tests (although this included the
% ‘brief presentation’ or ‘hidden match’ test).  They did not administer the
% ‘nuts in a can’ or ‘candy in a box’ tasks, which are the ones which,
% according to Frank et al, depend the most on memory and transpositional
% abilities.
Strikingly, these Pirah\~{a} have access to a language\footnote{It is a pidgin,
but by the above definition, no less a language.} with number words, but still
do not think numerically. 
% Although they did perform better on the quantity-matching tasks than members
% of villages where no such number training had occured.
This shows that there must be something beyond the limits of the language to
which they have access causing this particular difference in their mode of
thought. I argue that it is culture, influencing thought directly, without
language as a mediating variable; rather than culture influencing language and
language subsequently influencing thought, culture directly affects both
language and thought, making the influence of language on thought trivial.
% I like this argument, although, to be complete, it needs development in the
% form of an explanation of the means by which culture affects thought.  What,
% indeed, is meant by ‘culture’ here?  What is certainly true is that ‘culture’
% is a potentially confounding variable in the Piraha studies, whose presence
% weakens the interpretation of the experimental results as caused by the
% influence of language. 

For \citeA{Agar95}, language cannot be separated from culture. This means that
a difference in the way two groups of people think may be a result of
differences between their respective languages or differences between their
respective cultures, but it is impossible to tell which (or, perhaps,
meaningless to do so). If we adopt this view, that language and culture are
necessarily intertwined, the question of Linguistic Relativity is absurd and
the research on the topic even more so. It is meaningless to conduct a study
about perceptions of the color blue and attribute findings to the difference
between Russian and English as languages. The differences obviously have just
as much to do with cultural discourses of color: speakers of Russian are raised
with differing descriptions of light and dark blue as a part of their culture.
It is not possible to disentangle those experiences from their understanding of
language and their formation of mental categories. Similarly, claims that
Guugu-Yimidhirr, the language, prevents its speakers from thinking in terms of
left and right miss that it may be the culture itself which prevents them, if
anything does, from thinking in that way.

In conclusion, there is no non-trivial sense in which Linguistic Relativity is
true. The language and thought of a particular person are correlated, as proven
in the literature.  Thus, the weakest possible formulation of Linguistic
Relativity is true. However, it is trivially true. As a finding, it tells us
nothing about the working of thought or language. There is no way to establish
from this correlation a causal mechanism and no hope of eliminating confounds. 
% Good point.
The only way to salvage Linguistic Relativity as a claim is to incorporate
culture as an inalienable element of language, which is to change completely
what is meant by the term . Thus, I reject Linguistic Relativism as a useful or
accurate hypothesis. This does not mean that I accept pre-Boas understandings
of the world, or think that all humans have practically identical thoughts
labelled differently by their languages. Instead, I advocate a hypothesis and a
research agenda what I will, in honor of Agar, call Languacultural
Relativity.\footnote{Even though it sounds really horrible} That is to say , I
acknowledge that different groups of people have vastly different cultures.
They speak a wide variety of languages which possess dissimilar structures and
lexicons. I also think that they experience incomparable cultures. Those
cultures undoubtably 
%undoubtedly
impact their languages but likewise influence their thought directly. To tease
apart these causes is impossible. They must be studied together, and that is
how their study will be most valuable. To tell us about the variety of human
language and human thought, the linguistic anthropologist must not simply do
linguistics; she must do anthropology.

% Excellent, Edward: indeed, the best paper I think I’ve ever received on
% linguistic relativity – and I’ve had lots of them over the years.  Moreover,
% most linguistic anthropologists today would agree with you, that is, those
% who, like Agar, don’t buy into the ‘inside the Circle’ concept of a language.

% Grade: A+

% You’re doing a good job in class discussion as well.
