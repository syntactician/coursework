expertise that comes into play in the discursive construction of a regional dialect, in public
interaction that includes both institutionally-sanctioned experts like linguists and laypeo-
ple with other sources of expertise. Based on an analysis of discourse about Pittsburgh
speech, or ``Pittsburghese,'' in print newspapers, a website, an online discussion board,
and a Wikipedia entry, it is argued that both scholars interested in the historical process
of language-making and those interested in interaction with the public on the topic of
non-standard varieties can benefit from thinking about the role of technology in determin-
ing whose voices are heard when.},

@article{Slotta12,
	Abstract = {This paper examines the enregisterment of dialect shibboleths among the Yopno of Papua
New Guinea. The Yopno recognize dialect shibboleths as indexes of a speaker's ``home vil-
lage,'' yet people employ dialect shibboleths associated with others' villages in systematic
ways, offering little explicit metapragmatic commentary about such uses. Through the
analysis of two interactional events, this paper demonstrates how the social meaning of
using another's dialect shibboleths is generated through figures of speech (i.e. tropes) that
are manifest in the implicit metapragmatic structuring of discourse through parallelism.
Though much work on enregisterment foregrounds the role of explicit metapragmatic dis-
course in the process, this case highlights the important role played by tropes figured in the
implicit metapragmatic structuring of discourse.},
