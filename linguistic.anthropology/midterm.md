## Required
1. List the 6 factors of the speech event and their corresponding functions. For each one, supply an illustrative example and an explanation of how the example fulfills the function in question.
	* Context --- Referential
		* "I'm sitting in a chair."
		* Referential meaning has to do with semantic meaning, and how the utterance refers to things. Here, "I" refers to a person, "chair" refers to an object, and "sitting" refers to our relation.
	* Message --- Poetic
		* "Dont sing,  
			don't do anything,  
			just drive."
		* This utterance has parallel structures and rhyme between the first two clauses, which serve to unify them and distinguish the third and final clause, which contains the message. It uses properties of language to produce or accentuate the message.
	* Addresser --- Expressive
		* "Oh"
		* In the "Trip to Syracuse" phone call, Ilene expresses her emotional state upon realizing that Charlie is not, in fact, taking her to Syracuse.
	* Addressee --- Conative
		* "How are you?"
		* A conative utterance involves the addressee. All second-person speech qualifies.
	* Mode --- Phatic
		* "Hello?" -- in a phone call
		* During a phone call, it is necessary (or at least customary) to establish that your interlocutor is connected to the line and able to hear you clearly. This is a primary function of the phone "hello," which is particular to the phone as a mode of communication. Both Charlie and Ilene do this during their phone call.
	* Code --- Metalinguistic
		* "I talked to the girl."
		* The example discusses language itself. Charlie is discussing a previous linguistic activity.

## Answer 6 of the following:
2. By reference to an example of a sign, explain the difference between an utterance which has a metasemantic function and an utterance with a metapragmatic function.
	* "What do you mean?"
		* I might ask someone this if I fail to understand the propositional or referential content of their last statement. I'm asking about the semantic meaning of that utterance.
	* A: "Can you make it tomorrow morning?"  
	  B: "I'm busy."  
	  A: "So, you can't make it?"
		* The final question in this exchange is about not the propositional content of the second, but rather what it was meant to convey pragmatically. "I'm busy." does not just convey business, but rather a denial of the question of the first utterance; the third utterance metapragmatically addresses that meaning.

3. By reference to an example, explain how it signifies by more than one sign mode.
	* "Woof woof"
	* This sign signifies both as icon and as index. It signifies as icon the sound of a dog, suggesting the dog itself. It also (like much onomatopoeia) indexes childishness.

4. By reference to an example, explain why deictic indexes are called 'shifters.'
	* Deictic indexes (e.g. "here," "now") are context dependent. To understand what you mean by "I am here, now," I have to know both where and when the utterance occurred. The meaning changes (or "shifts") if it is uttered elsewhere or at a different time.

6. Explain the difference between what Malinowski calls the 'pragmatic function' and the 'intellectual function' of the speech event.
	* For Malinowski, the intellectual function of a speech event consists in its semantico-referential function, or what it conveys as information to the hearer. Its pragmatic function is "the change produced by the sound in the behavior of people," of what it is that the speech act does, rather than conveys.

7. How does Agha define a "register?"
	* Agha defines a register as "a linguistic repertoire that is associated, culture-internally, with particular social practices and persons who engage in such practices."

8. Explain the difference between an individual's register range and the social domain of a register.
	* An individual's register range is the variety of registers to which they have access. The social domain of a register is the variety of social contexts or situations in which it might be appropriate or useful to use that register. For instance, I have access to border Mexican drug slang (it is in my register range), but talking to my suburban friends at dinner, it is not useful or appropriate to use it (that context is outside the social domain of that register).

## Paragraph Answers: Do 2 of 3.
10. By reference to an example of a particular register, explain how institutions of register replication cause social asymmetries.

Schools and grammar texts replicate Standardized English, and together comprise an institution of register replication. This replication is most effective in wealthy, white students who attend affluent schools. Obviously, access to these institutions is differential along race and class lines. Particular sorts of students receive extensive training in the Standardized English register required for school, while others receive little to no training in it. This causes social (and economic) asymmetry by way of affecting the college and career opportunities of speakers. Those with access to these institutions, and therefore Standardized English, have more and better college and white-collar career opportunities open to theme.

12. Explain an example of a contrary-to-stereotype use of a register's forms which has a tropic significance.
	
White boys and men use African American English (or what they think African American English is) in a variety of tropic ways. White boys are outside of the stereotype associated with the register, so their use is necessarily contrary-to-stereotype. African American English is often used in an attempt to index masculinity or sports aptitude, evoking obvious tropes about black men. Gay white men often use a particular register stereotypically associated with Black women, which draws on tropes of "angry" or "sassy" Black women, to build a particular social image for the speaker.
