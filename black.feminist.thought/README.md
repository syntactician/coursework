# Black Feminist Thought — Bettina Judd
### Fall 2015 — Gender, Sexuality and Women's Studies 390 (Africana Studies 306) 

#### Course Description
In order to understand the growing body of scholarship that is Black feminist
theory, we will analyze the development of Black women's feminist consciousness
from the mid-19th century to the present through the essays, speeches, and
creative work that has named the complex systems of power which affect the
lives of Black women on the primary intersections of race, gender and class. We
will examine closely the important contributions of Black feminist thought to
the fields of African American and Africana Studies and Women’s and Gender
Studies through concepts developed by Black feminist scholars such as
intersectionality.
