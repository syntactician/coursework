According to Johnson, this work is also useful for its historical account of Jones' relation to the Communist Party of the United States, which I imagine may be important to understanding her ideological positions.},

	Annote = {This is a dissenting review of McDuffie (2011) and to a lesser extent of Davies (2008). It seems to assert both that some of their analysis is ahistorical and that their ideological positions are unsound. Because I am not well read in Soviet history, I expect that this source (and the journal it is published in) will help me broaden my understanding of the historical context of both Jones and her biographers. I also expect that addressing the criticisms this author raises will help me deepen my understanding of the biographies. In addition, it has already pointed me toward literature I hadn't already found (Sherwood, 2000).},

@book{McDuffie11,
	Abstract = {Sojourning for Freedom portrays pioneering black women activists from the early twentieth century through the 1970s, focusing on their participation in the U.S. Communist Party (CPUSA) between 1919 and 1956. Erik S. McDuffie considers how women from diverse locales and backgrounds became radicalized, joined the CPUSA, and advocated a pathbreaking politics committed to black liberation, women's rights, decolonization, economic justice, peace, and international solidarity. McDuffie explores the lives of black left feminists, including the bohemian world traveler Louise Thompson Patterson, who wrote about the ``triple exploitation'' of race, gender, and class; Esther Cooper Jackson, an Alabama-based civil rights activist who chronicled the experiences of black female domestic workers; and Claudia Jones, the Trinidad-born activist who emerged as one of the Communist Party's leading theorists of black women's exploitation. Drawing on more than forty oral histories collected from veteran black women radicals and their family members, McDuffie examines how these women negotiated race, gender, class, sexuality, and politics within the CPUSA. In Sojourning for Freedom, he depicts a community of radical black women activist intellectuals who helped to lay the foundation for a transnational modern black feminism.},

@book{Davies08,
	Abstract = {In Left of Karl Marx, Carole Boyce Davies assesses the activism, writing, and legacy of Claudia Jones (1915--1964), a pioneering Afro-Caribbean radical intellectual, dedicated communist, and feminist. Jones is buried in London's Highgate Cemetery, to the left of Karl Marx---a location that Boyce Davies finds fitting given how Jones expanded Marxism-Leninism to incorporate gender and race in her political critique and activism.

Claudia Cumberbatch Jones was born in Trinidad. In 1924, she moved to New York, where she lived for the next thirty years. She was active in the Communist Party from her early twenties onward. A talented writer and speaker, she traveled throughout the United States lecturing and organizing. In the early 1950s, she wrote a well-known column, ``Half the World,'' for the Daily Worker. As the U.S. government intensified its efforts to prosecute communists, Jones was arrested several times. She served nearly a year in a U.S. prison before being deported and given asylum by Great Britain in 1955. There she founded The West Indian Gazette and Afro-Asian Caribbean News and the Caribbean Carnival, an annual London festival that continues today as the Notting Hill Carnival. Boyce Davies examines Jones's thought and journalism, her political and community organizing, and poetry that the activist wrote while she was imprisoned. Looking at the contents of the FBI file on Jones, Boyce Davies contrasts Jones's own narration of her life with the federal government's. Left of Karl Marx establishes Jones as a significant figure within Caribbean intellectual traditions, black U.S. feminism, and the history of communism.},
	Annote = {Several sources I've run into so far have listed this as the premier "political biography" of Claudia Jones. I expect that it will give me not only a picture of her life (which I expect the other biographies in this list are capable of doing as well) but an idea of the origins and development of her political ideas. It also purports to analyze Jones' journalism and her place within Carribean intellectual traditions, which no other source I've found has discussed at all.},
