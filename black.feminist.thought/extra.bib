@book{Davies08,
	Abstract = {In Left of Karl Marx, Carole Boyce Davies assesses the
		activism, writing, and legacy of Claudia Jones (1915--1964), a
		pioneering Afro-Caribbean radical intellectual, dedicated communist,
		and feminist. Jones is buried in London's Highgate Cemetery, to the
		left of Karl Marx---a location that Boyce Davies finds fitting given
		how Jones expanded Marxism-Leninism to incorporate gender and race in
		her political critique and activism.

		Claudia Cumberbatch Jones was born in Trinidad. In 1924, she moved to
		New York, where she lived for the next thirty years. She was active in
		the Communist Party from her early twenties onward. A talented writer
		and speaker, she traveled throughout the United States lecturing and
		organizing. In the early 1950s, she wrote a well-known column, ``Half
		the World,'' for the Daily Worker. As the U.S. government intensified
		its efforts to prosecute communists, Jones was arrested several times.
		She served nearly a year in a U.S. prison before being deported and
		given asylum by Great Britain in 1955. There she founded The West
		Indian Gazette and Afro-Asian Caribbean News and the Caribbean
		Carnival, an annual London festival that continues today as the Notting
		Hill Carnival. Boyce Davies examines Jones's thought and journalism,
		her political and community organizing, and poetry that the activist
		wrote while she was imprisoned. Looking at the contents of the FBI file
		on Jones, Boyce Davies contrasts Jones's own narration of her life with
		the federal government's. Left of Karl Marx establishes Jones as a
		significant figure within Caribbean intellectual traditions, black U.S.
		feminism, and the history of communism.},
	Annote = {Several sources I've run into so far have listed this as the
		premier "political biography" of Claudia Jones. I expect that it will
		give me not only a picture of her life (which I expect the other
		biographies in this list are capable of doing as well) but an idea of
		the origins and development of her political ideas. It also purports to
		analyze Jones' journalism and her place within Carribean intellectual
		traditions, which no other source I've found has discussed at all.},

@article{Hinds08,
	Abstract = {The West Indian Gazette, edited by Claudia Jones, and on which
		Donald Hinds was a writer, was one of the most influential pioneers of
		a genuinely independent black press in Britain. To say that Claudia
		herself was a communist, feminist and anti-imperialist does not express
		the dynamism and humanity of her politics, or their innovative nature
		--- including the introduction of the first black carnival in Britain.
		She, and the Gazette, were immensely important in the creation of the
		black community in Britain from the late 1950s onwards, as it was beset
		by an ongoing and crude racism, including the riots of Notting Hill and
		Nottingham. },

@book{McDuffie11,
	Abstract = {Sojourning for Freedom portrays pioneering black women
		activists from the early twentieth century through the 1970s, focusing
		on their participation in the U.S. Communist Party (CPUSA) between 1919
		and 1956. Erik S. McDuffie considers how women from diverse locales and
		backgrounds became radicalized, joined the CPUSA, and advocated a
		pathbreaking politics committed to black liberation, women's rights,
		decolonization, economic justice, peace, and international solidarity.
		McDuffie explores the lives of black left feminists, including the
		bohemian world traveler Louise Thompson Patterson, who wrote about the
		``triple exploitation'' of race, gender, and class; Esther Cooper
		Jackson, an Alabama-based civil rights activist who chronicled the
		experiences of black female domestic workers; and Claudia Jones, the
		Trinidad-born activist who emerged as one of the Communist Party's
		leading theorists of black women's exploitation. Drawing on more than
		forty oral histories collected from veteran black women radicals and
		their family members, McDuffie examines how these women negotiated
		race, gender, class, sexuality, and politics within the CPUSA. In
		Sojourning for Freedom, he depicts a community of radical black women
		activist intellectuals who helped to lay the foundation for a
		transnational modern black feminism.},
